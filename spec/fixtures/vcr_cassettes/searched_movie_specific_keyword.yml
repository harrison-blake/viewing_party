        the true history of the era of pulp fiction and the golden age of science
        fiction, fantasy and adventure. Pulp fiction, named for the low quality paper
        on which the stories were printed, blossomed in the early twentieth century.
        After WWI and the Great Depression, audiences sought tales with strong heroes,
        exciting adventures and alien encounters. This entertaining documentary traces
        the golden years of pulps, beginning in the 1920''s, by highlighting numerous
        writers including Erle Stanley Gardner and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Popular and
        prolific authors Ray Bradbury and Frederik Pohl recall the days of nominal
        pay, short deadlines, and the insatiable demand for copy. Special coverage
        is given to the original cover art that defined pulp, featuring beautiful
        women, space creatures and blazing weapons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"release_date":"2010-01-01","title":"UFOTV
