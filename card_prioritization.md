## Project Card Prioritization

#### Group: Harrison Blake, Jacob Arellano, Genevieve Nuebel

* We have opted to tackle the welcome page as our first user story. Once we complete these we are going to take care of the chore, or housekeeping items:
  * Travis CI
  * Deploy to Heroku
  * Rubocop

* Following the welcome page we believe we must integrate the Registration page and the user authentication/authorization.

* Next we wish to tackle the dashboard user stories, excluding the Friends. We believe the Movie stories can also be done concurrently.

* We have opted to implement the ability to add friends after completing the above, as the previous user stories do not appear to have any critical dependencies.

* Lastly, we will implement the necessary CRUD functionality for a viewing party and include that in the dashboard.

* We have not determined which story we do for exploration, we have decided as a group to do that after completing MVP.
